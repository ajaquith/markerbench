A while ago I wrote a blog post called [Escaping the Hamster Wheel of Pain](/pages/Welcome-blogentry-040505-1.html) decrying the lather-rinse-repeat cycle that the security industry seems to be fixated on. Here are some hamster wheels I've been collecting. I've obscured the names, sort of. I make no comment on these other than to note with amusement that they all resemble each other.
