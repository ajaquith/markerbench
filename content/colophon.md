## Platform

This website is statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a Go-powered site generator that cleanly separates format from content, using Hugo&rsquo;s excellent templating system. Static sites offer [superior security compared to a typical CMS-hosted site](https://www.markerbench.com/posts/static-blogging/) because the contents are served as simple, inert, portable, pre-generated HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As a result, servers are not needed, and any cloud caching service can host the content. Repelling the wily hacker is a side benefit. GitHub Pages hosts these pages as a serverless website. GitHub Actions regenerates and deploys the entire Markerbench site automatically when a new build is pushed to the [Markerbench GitHub repository](https://github.com/ajaquith/markerbench), generally in two minutes or less.

## Theme

The website theme is Andrew&rsquo;s [forked and  expanded version](https://github.com/ajaquith/mediumish-gohugo-theme) of the [Mediumish](https://github.com/lgaida/mediumish-gohugo-theme) Hugo theme, which itself is a port of the Bootstrapped [Mediumish Jekyll theme](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll) by WowThemes.Net&mdash;all of which begs Pablo Picasso&rsquo;s point that &ldquo;Good artists copy, great artists steal.&rdquo; Whether this website qualifies as great art, or something less than that, is an exercise left to the reader.

## Images

Speaking of art, Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;AI&rdquo;-powered [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create) generated the images on the homepage hero carousel from the following prompts:

- &ldquo;In an impressionist style, I would like to see a zen pond with smooth, glasslike water but with a few small ripples.&rdquo;
- &ldquo;In an impressionist style, I would like to see a happy boardroom meeting with laughter and some champagne.&rdquo;
- &ldquo;I want to see, in an impressionist style, a picture of steel being cast in a steel mill, with a dark background and bright orange molten steel being cast.&rdquo;
- &ldquo;I want to see a picture painted in an impressionist style of the earth on a white background, being lifted up by a woman on a gigantic seesaw, with the earth on the high side.&rdquo;

Creating stock images using prompts is great fun, but some of the early drafts&mdash;notably, the  seesaw image&mdash;were not suitable for publication. When asked to generate an image of an &ldquo;athletic&rdquo; woman moving the Earth, Bing rendered a Skims-thonged Kardashian. Go figure.

## Typesetting

The Markerbench website is set in [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond), an Open-Font-Licensed typeface by Georg Mayr-Duffner and Octavio Pardo. EB Garamond is a tasteful and high-quality interpretation of Claude Garamond&rsquo;s famous Garamond old-style typeface from a specimen created in 1592, with italics following Robert Granjon&rsquo;s designs. EB Garamond compares favorably with Adobeâ€™s superb [Adobe Garamond Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/adobe-garamond), designed by Robert Slimbach, but at a much lower cost&mdash;free!&mdash;and with the benefit of Google&rsquo;s font hosting service.
