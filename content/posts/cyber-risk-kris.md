During our initial review, we identified opportunites to improve the relevance and transparency of our clientâ€™s metrics. As we found them, the KRIs were too opaque and didn&rsquo;t spur the right kinds of conversations. Senior stakeholders told us that the indexes used as risk indicators were confusing. Nobody could explain how they worked, what they were made of, how the index components were weighted, what the weights were sensitive to, or how the scores drove corrective actions.

## Passing the ABCDE Test

To be useful, metrics&mdash;especially those used for KRIs&mdash; need to pass the &ldquo;A-B-C-D-E&rdquo; test. You need to know the:

- __Audience__. Who are the metrics for, and how will they be presented? For example, does your recipients prefer data incorporated into an emailed narrative, in an online dashboard, in a presentation, or on paper?
- __Behaviors__. What behaviors should recipients exhibit when they see the metrics? Should they pat themselves on the back, scratch their heads, or do something important?
- __Context__. Are the numbers accompanied by narrative that explains why they should care, or how the data fit into the bigger picture?
- __Decisions__. What decisions should recipients make as a result?
- __Editorial voice__. Are the accompanied by prescriptive guidance or advice that decision-makers shold consider? Numbers aren&rsquo;t just clinical markers.

Cyber program managers are often tempted to re-purpose measurements about their controls (&ldquo;Key Control Indicators&rdquo; and &ldquo;Key Performance Indicators&rdquo;) as KRIs. That can work, but it risks misreading your audience, who may not understand what you are talking about, why it matters, or what needs to be done.
