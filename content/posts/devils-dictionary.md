Just saw the very funny [Devil's InfoSec Dictionary](http://www.csoonline.com/read/080105/debrief.html) on the CSO site. Of course, I had to add a few definitions of my own:

* __Blended threat__: a hemlock smoothie
* __Process, Security Is A__: a throw-away line that explains why security measurement is impossible
* __Risk management__: a repeated process around the Hamster Wheel of Pain that vendors use to enumerate vulnerabilities you didn't know you had, followed by serial remediation of same. See "remediation"
* __Remediation__: furious arm-flapping and showy activity designed to convince bosses that something is actually being done about vulnerabilities identified by third parties
* __Spear phishing__: a sport undertaken by illiterate anglers
