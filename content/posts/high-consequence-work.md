This article kicks off a short series for CISOs about “high-consequence work”: attacking hard problems that can make or break your reputation as a practitioner. Each article frames an issue, describes why it’s important, outlines how to approach it, refers you to other resources you may can use to dig deeper, and closes with some personal observations. These are written Axios-style: fast, hard-hitting, and opinionated. I’d love your comments and feedback.

Hack-Proofing the Help Desk. Your help desk is under pressure. Recent breaches (MGM, Okta) have shown that attackers increasingly target help desks to fraudulently gain access to sensitive and administrative accounts. In this engagement, we review and test your support staff's runbooks, procedures, and password reset processes. We simulate an adversary through trickery, deepfakes, and realistic phishing tests. And we work with you to rapidly improve your help desk's resilience without compromising service.

Red Flags Assessment. Considing taking a company public, or acquiring an existing one? You want to know whether your target has material cyber weaknesses that could result in millions of dollars in breach costs or mandatory improvements. In this engagement, we rapidly assess the target's architecture, policies, procesures, and organization; identify “red flags” that could lead to a signficant compromise, and estimate rough order-of-magnitude capital and expenses to set aside or discount against the deal. 

Splitting Your Network. Are you concerned that your network is too “flat” and exposed to potentially hostile geographies? Geopolitical risks from China, Russia, and other states are real, and multi-pronged. In this engagement, we rapidly review your network segmentation and plan a phased strategy for splitting your Layer 1-5 traffic, isolating key applications, collaboration platforms and data stores, and re-writing and re-routing email, and implementing a tamperproof identity management plan, all without compromising your ability to do business transnationally.
