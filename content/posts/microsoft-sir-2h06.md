This is essentially a forward reference to a comment I made to another blog, but as it is related to the nature of reporting for vulnerabilities and quantitative progress against them, perhaps it is relevant here.

The topic is the "Microsoft Security Intelligence Report 2H06" and the [comments follow the initial discussion](http://blogs.csoonline.com/microsoft_security_intelligence_report_2h06).
