At the risk of turning this into a link blog, here are two nifty articles that drifted across my field of view today:

* [Google: Putting Crowd Wisdom to Work](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/putting-crowd-wisdom-to-work.html). Interesting article about how Google uses "prediction markets" inside Google to forecast the likelihood of future events. There's been a lively discussion on the [mailing list](http://www.securitymetrics.org) about this lately, so it's quite timely.
* [User triangulation: how to listen to customers](http://www.heynorton.org/blog/2005/09/user_triangulat.html). Breaks down customers into Influential Adopters, Leading Adopters, Middle Adopters, and Late Adopters. I've seen articles on this subject before, but this one is short, sweet, and well-written. A useful tonic to product managers everywhere.
Both are well worth reading.
