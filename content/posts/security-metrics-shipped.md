Greetings everybody! I am pleased to announce that my book, [Security Metrics: Replacing Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt](http://www.amazon.com/Security-Metrics-Replacing-Uncertainty-Doubt/dp/0321349989/) has shipped from the printers and is on its way to better bookstores near you. You can also pre-order from Amazon. I have a printed copy in my hot little hands, and it looks great!

I'd like to thank my agent, my producer and my good friend Walter Matthau.

In all seriousness, as a first-time author I am especially gratified to finally see and touch the tangible result. Many people, including at least one ex-girlfriend, thought it would be a cold day in hell before this thing ever saw the light of day. As a serial perfectionist and sometime procrastinator, that was always a real risk. But my intrinsic stubborness — a trait I got from my brassy, scone-making Irish grandmother — guaranteed that sooner or later I'd get it done. (Friendly pressure from my editor helped too.)

In the end, I did what Microsoft did with Vista — I cut features until it shipped. The original table of contents called for about fifteen chapters; the finished book has eight. But the chapters I shipped are deeper, and better in many ways, than what I initially envisioned.

I didn't get a chance to _really_ read the book all the way through until the galley proofs arrived — before that, I was a little “too close” to it. Nothing is ever perfect for me, and after a while I become fatigued, numb and just plain cranky about what I felt were all of its flaws. But most of these are things readers will never see. Despite all that, I am still very happy with the result, and delighted with how well it flows and tells a story.

Overall, this is an exciting day. Feel free to buy lots of copies of _Security Metrics_ for yourself, your family and friends. It makes a great gift!
