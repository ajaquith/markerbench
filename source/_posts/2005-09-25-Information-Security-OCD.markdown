Just saw the Scorsese/DiCaprio film _The Aviator_ for the first time. The film is remarkable not just for its lush cinematography, crisp writing and convincing special effects, but also for its frankness in documenting Howard Hughes' Obsessive-Compusive Disorder (OCD). 

At the risk of sounding a bit like [this guy](http://security.typepad.com/internet_security_be_care/), the OCD motif, particularly the bit at the end where he repeats, _ad nauseum_, "the way of the future... the way of the future... the way of the future..." reminds me a bit of the repetitive, compulsive fixation of late on so-called intellectual property leak detection. One might say that perfidious insiders are a germ of a different sort, from which we can never get clean. Repeat after me:

the insider threat   
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat  
the insider threat
