Mark Curphey's [cynical vehicle for ripping the security industry](http://www.securitybullsit.com) gains another blunt instrument: [the Hamster Wheel of Pain](http://securitybullshit.com/2007/02/28/cartoon-022-the-hamster-wheel-of-pain/), featured in Chapter One in [Security Metrics: Replacing Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt](http://www.amazon.com/Security-Metrics-Replacing-Uncertainty-Doubt/dp/0321349989). Mark was kind enough commission a cartoon based a quick e-mail from me. I think the cartoon shows that I am at least as cynical as he.
