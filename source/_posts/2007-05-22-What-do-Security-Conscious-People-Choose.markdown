At security conferences and events, I have noticed that the distribution of operating systems seems to differ somewhat from what I read in the papers. As my last post showed, the Internet Identity Workshop skewed decidedly in the Mac direction. 

I thought it would be fun to put together a quick poll asking the members of the securitymetrics.org mailing what operating systems they used. I sent out a note asking the membership to respond to two simple questions:

<!--more-->

* What is the operating system and e-mail client you use at _work_?
* What is the operating system and e-mail client you use at _home_ (or for personal activities)?

I've compiled some preliminary statistics for your reading pleasure. Thanks to the 27 people who responded out of a total membership of about 300. That's nearly a 10% response rate in less than a day — not bad at all!

### Objectives and Methodology
The goal of this little survey was to try and figure out if self-selected, security conscious people had a preference for operating systems or e-mail clients that differed markedly from the  mainstream.

I've compiled operating system and e-mail statistics from three related sources:

* Responses to my previous e-mail (27 replies) — what is your operating system and e-mail client at work and at home?
* Analysis of e-mail "X-Mailer" and related headers from the securitymetrics.org mailing list (20 June 2006 to present)
* Analysis of same from metricon@securitymetrics.org traffic (_i.e._, paper submissions) (31 March 2006 to present)

In total, I identified 170 people who have contributed to this mailing list or sent submissions to Metricon 1.0 and 2.0. Of those, 27 provided OS/email information to me directly; I relied on header analysis for the remaining 143.

In total, I was able to identify a "preferred" operating system (either the one specified as the 'home' OS in a direct e-mail to me, or the one identified in the header) for 93 people. I identified e-mail programs for 131 people.

### Operating Systems
For respondents who contacted me directly, and specified their work OS (_n_=27), Windows was the majority OS.
<table class="table table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>#</th><th>%</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>Windows</td><td>15</td><td>56%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Linux</td><td>5</td><td>19%</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS X</td><td>7</td><td>26%</td></tr>
</table>

For home (_n_=28), the results are quite different:
<table class="table table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>#</th><th>%</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>Windows</td><td>8</td><td>29%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Linux</td><td>7</td><td>25%</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS X</td><td>13</td><td>46%</td></tr>
</table>

Of the 27 respondents, 14 (55%) reported using a different OS at home compared to work. After taking into account X-Mailer headers, I've concluded that for members of this list ("security conscious people"), we can conclude that when they have a choice, our members slightly prefer Macs. Results (_n_=92):
<table class="table table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>#</th><th>%</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>Windows</td><td>38</td><td>41%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Linux</td><td>15</td><td>16%</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS X</td><td>39</td><td>42%</td></tr>
</table>

Amazingly enough, this suggests that Windows is a minority operating system, at least on this list. 

### E-Mail Clients
For respondents who specified their work e-mail client (_n_=27), Microsoft Outlook was the majority client.
<table class="table table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>#</th><th>%</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>Outlook</td><td>14</td><td>52%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thunderbird</td><td>4</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apple Mail</td><td>3</td><td>11%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mutt</td><td>2</td><td>7%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td><td>4</td><td>15%</td></tr>
</table>

For home (_n_=28), the results are, once again, quite different — and quite diverse:
<table class="table table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>#</th><th>%</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>Thunderbird</td><td>7</td><td>25%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apple Mail</td><td>6</td><td>21%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Outlook</td><td>3</td><td>11%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Google Mail</td><td>3</td><td>11%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pine</td><td>2</td><td>7%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mutt</td><td>2</td><td>7%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td><td>5</td><td>18%</td></tr>
</table>

Of the 28 respondents, nearly 2/3 (17 or 63%) specified a different home e-mail client compared to the one they used at work. After analysis of X-Mailer headers is taken into account (_n_=131), I conclude that our members prefer webmail overall, and prefer free (and non-Microsoft) native clients.
<table class="table table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>#</th><th>%</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>Google Mail</td><td>23</td><td>18%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thunderbird</td><td>22</td><td>17%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apple Mail</td><td>20</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Outlook</td><td>20</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lotus Notes</td><td>10</td><td>8%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td><td>36</td><td>27%</td></tr>
</table>

Interesting, no? Statistically relevant — maybe not! Let the debates begin in earnest!
